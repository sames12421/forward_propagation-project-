# forward_propagation-project-
🔁 forward_propagation is a beginner-friendly deep learning project that demonstrates how input data flows through a neural network to produce outputs. It manually implements the forward propagation process using basic Python and NumPy, helping users understand core neural network operations like weighted sums and activation functions.
